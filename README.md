# Problem Statement
Since 2008, guests and hosts have used Airbnb to expand on traveling possibilities and present a more unique, personalized way of experiencing the world. Today, Airbnb became one of a kind service that is used and recognized by the whole world. Data analysis on millions of listings provided through Airbnb is a crucial factor for the company. These millions of listings generate a lot of data - data that can be analyzed and used for security, business decisions, understanding of customers' and providers' (hosts) behavior and performance on the platform, guiding marketing initiatives, implementation of innovative additional services and much more. This dataset has around 49,000 observations in it with 16 columns and it is a mix between categorical and numeric values.

Explore and analyze the data to discover key understandings.

# Project Files :
Airbnb Bookings Analysis-Capstone Project.ipynb - This file includes complete implementation of the project such as Features description, exploratory data Analysis done on the dataset.
Project PPT - This is a power point presentation file for the project. It includes various visualaized plots of EDA,conclusion and results.

# Data Pipeline
**Data Understanding:** This step includes a general walk through over the dataset knowing the dimensions of the dataset, datatype, different features, Checking for missing values.

**Data Processing:** At this stage i have dropped two column that had some null value and also were less relevant to the scope of our analysis, this is done to keep our data set small and concise so that handling would be easy,looked forward to the outliers to keep our data free from any anomaly and hence found the price column to skewed towards the right and for that purpose we used median values where the analysis is done on the basis of price.

**Exploratory Data Analysis:** EDA or Exploratory Data Analysis is the critical process of performing the initial investigation on the data. So, through this we have observed certain trends and dependencies and also drawn certain conclusions from the dataset that will be useful for further processing.

# Conclusions

1) This Airbnb (NYC 2019) Dataset For The Year 2019 Appeared to be a very rich Dataset with a variety of coloumns that allowed us to do deep data exploration.

2) First,we have found hosts that take good advantage of the Airbnb platform and provide the most listing.Thus,we found that our top host (Sonder) has 327 listings.

3) On the basis of reviews the neighbourhood group,Queens has maximum number of reviews followed by others.so,if there are more number of Reviews for particular Neighbourhood group that means that place is a tourist place.

3) Manhattan is the busiest neighbourhood place as the minimum night spend is maximum compared to others.so,if people are not staying more then one night means they are travellers.

4) From the above analysis we can conclude that most of the people choose entire home apartment as their first choice.
