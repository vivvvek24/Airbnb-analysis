# An Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) project on Airbnb Bookings Analysis.

One of the biggest challenges for Airbnb is to maintain positive customer experience along with having a financially profitable business model for property owners. How factors are affecting the price for the Airbnb listing in NYC? What is the overall location distribution of Airbnb NYC? Which neighbourhood has a better average price for the Airbnb listing? Our goal is to build a statistical model to effectively predict the price for the listings and company can use this model to come up with a price suggestion for the future listings.

The libraries that are used in this project are:

1. Pandas
2. Matplotlib
3. Seaborn These libraries helped in data handling and visualization.
